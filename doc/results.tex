\textsc{Socrates}: Imagine this: People live under the earth in a cavelike dwelling. ... The people have been in this dwelling since childhood, shackled by the legs and neck. ... Some light, namely from a fire that casts its glow toward them from behind them, ... Between the fire and those who are shackled there runs a walkway at a certain height. ... a low wall has been built the length of the walkway, like the low curtain that puppeteers put up, ... along this low wall people are carrying all sorts of things that reach up higher than the wall.
